## Introduction

This project contains all the necessary things to get started with writing an API in NodeJS. It includes Inversify, Inversify-Express-Utils for dependency injection, sequelize for the database ORM, and jest for testing.

The idea of this project is to bring a batteries included project that is not too opinionated, yet brings in libraries that allow for the creation of API using NodeJS

The initial template shows an example with a basic CRUD application using sequelize-typecript. Since the structure of the project is split up into features, you can delete the **todo** folder inside api and remove the *todoModule* from inversify.config.ts, so it is no longer part of the application.

The repository tries to follow the [best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)for structuring a repository. 


## What this repository does not have

* Authentication: The passport and passport-strategy should be left up to the user
  
* Session Management: This is up to the user, even though connect-redis is installed

* Logger: Besides logging of the API results, logging is up to the user


## Getting Started


> git clone https://github.com/josecolella/node-api-starter-template.git
