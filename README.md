## Introduction

This project contains all the necessary things to get started with writing an API in NodeJS. It includes Inversify, Inversify-Express-Utils for dependency injection, sequelize for the database ORM, and jest for testing.


The idea of this project is to bring a batteries included project that is not too opinionated, yet brings in libraries that allow for the creation of API using NodeJS


## Getting Started




The repository contains an example with two controllers; TodoController and HealthController with corresponding tests to show how to use jest, jest-express to test [inversify-express-utils](https://github.com/inversify/inversify-express-utils)
